The problem stems from Paul and Peter exchanging the same accounts
with differenct ordering. So that the sequence of blocking them
is different. If we enforce that for any two given arguments,
the sequence of them being blocked is the same, then the first block
from the second executed procedure cannot proceed because the account
is already blocked, which is correct bahavior.

I won't implement it because that's trivial.
(You have to impose strict linear order, in which no two accounts
have the same number, otherwise the ordering will not be corrected).
