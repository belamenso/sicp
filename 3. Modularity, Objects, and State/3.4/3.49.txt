Assume that we have provedure that does the following:
    1 block given resource
    2 reads the next resource to block from that resource
    3 block that read resource
    4 releases both blocks

Suppose we have resources A and B and two procedures called on them.
Ordering leading to deadlock:
    procA 1     block A
    procA 2     next := B
    procB 1     block B
    procB 2     next := A
deadlock:
    procA 3     has to wait, B blocked
    procB 3     has to wait, A blocked
    procA 3     has to wait, B blocked
    procB 3     has to wait, A blocked
    procA 3     has to wait, B blocked
    procB 3     has to wait, A blocked
    ...

A will not be available until B is and B won't be until A is.
