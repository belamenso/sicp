We'd need some kind of intelligent evaluator, manipulating expressions
algebraically first, and then recuding them possibly loosing accuracy.
However I'm not sure if it's possible to do this in all cases, there
are many mathematical identities that are extremally hard to notice or
proove to even experienced mathematicians, so I doubt anything short of
superhuman general-purpose AI would do the job.
